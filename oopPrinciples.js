// 1) Given an application that manages different types of animals, where
//    each animal can eat, sleep, make sounds, etc. but in different
//    ways - which principle of OOP most closely describes the features
//    outlined above?
// A: Polymorphism (different types of animals share the same broad
//    types of behaviors, although each animal has their own way of
//    implementing each behavior)



// 2) Given an application that manages different vehicles, each with a
//    make, model, year, and methods for starting, driving, and parking;
//    - All vehicles share the same methods, but the properties vary
//      between individual vehicles.
//    - Which OOP principle does this describe?
// A: Encapsulation (representing the behaviors and properties associated
//    with vehicles into individual vehicle objects)



// 3) In the example above, which items are part of a vehicle's state?
//    Which items specify its behavior?
// A: The make, model, and year represent each vehicle's state, while 
//    the `start`, `drive`, and `park` methods represent its behaviors.



// 4) Consider an application that manages a collection of living things:
// -- Plants include trees and flowers; animals include mammals and birds
// -- Which OOP principle does this setup describe?
// A: Inheritance - different object types are 'subclasses' of other
//    more general object types.
